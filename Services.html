 <!-- Facilities -->
        
 <section class="facilities" >
    <h1>Our Facilities</h1>
    <p>One of the distinguishing factors that marks Sidwah Clinic unique, with respect to other health facilities; such as, clinics and care centers is that they provide both inpatient and outpatient care provisions.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="facilities-col">
            <img src="images/f5.jpg">
                <h3>Dialysis Center</h3>
                <p>Patients with kidney disease often need regular treatments of dialysis. Dialysis is a process that filters and cleans the blood artificially—the work functioning kidneys normally take on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="facilities-col">
                <img src="images/f2.jpg">
                
                    <h3>Birth Center</h3>
                    <p>The birth center aim is to create a birth environment that feels more comfortable to the mother and allows for a cost-effective, family-inclusive birth.</p>
                
        </div>
        <div class="facilities-col">
                    <img src="images/f3.jpg">
                   
                    <h3>Medical Offices</h3>
                    <p>The medical office runs on communications, and they must be clear and complete as they will impact the health of the patients.</p>
                    
        </div>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="row">
        <div class="facilities-col">
           
            <img src="images/f1.jpg">
            
            <h3>Nursing Center</h3>
            <p>Ayurveda offers a living situation for patients whose medical needs aren’t severe enough for hospitalization, but are too serious to manage at home. Sidwah Clinic offers services for heavier medical needs, such as speech and occupational therapy. </p>
        
        </div>
           
        <div class="facilities-col">
                <img src="images/f6.jpg">
                
                    <h3>Hospice home</h3>
                    <p>Hospice can be a particularly confusing title. It represents a package of insurance benefits that deals with an end-of-life trajectory. It also represents a philosophy of care provision for dying patients as well as official networks that offer hospice care. Hospice is also a designation for specific healthcare facilities that specialize in end-of-life care.</p>
                
        </div>
        <div class="facilities-col">
                    <img src="images/f7.jpg">
                    
                    <h3>Radiology Center</h3>
                    <p>These facility, much like their hospital counterparts, offer diagnostic imaging services to patients. Diagnostic imaging includes CT scans, ultrasounds, X-rays, MRIs and more. While hospitals and even clinics have imaging centers, outpatient facilities help keep costs lower and allow more convenient scheduling for patients.</p>
                    
        </div>
       
    </div>
        <div class="row">
            
               
            <div class="facilities-col">
                <img src="images/f8.jpg">
            
                <h3>Mental Health Center</h3>
                <p>Mental health treatment facilities sometimes exist as a general institution for any mental health issue and are sometimes specialized. Examples of these kinds of facilities are suicidal thoughts (or suicidal ideation) treatment, depression treatment, trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment, treatment for anxiety disorders, behavioral disorders and more.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="facilities-col">
                        <img src="images/f11.jpg">
                        
                        <h3>Dermatology</h3>
                        <p>Cosmetic dermatology procedures are available on Sidwah Clinic's campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota. Specialists in cosmetic dermatology work with other specialty areas, including plastic and reconstructive surgery , ear, nose and throat ( otolaryngology ), gynecology , vascular surgery , and ophthalmology .</p>
                        
            </div>
            <div class="facilities-col">
                <img src="images/f12.jpg">
                
                <h3>Disability Service</h3>
                <p>Disability support services are instrumental in helping handicapped people develop skills and behaviours that assist them in the workforce. Disability support sees a handicap as something be overcome and works to mitigate the handicap’s effect on someone ability to lead a normal life.</p>
